    <p>Dear {name},</p>

    <p>Thank you for your pledge to the MaydayPAC. We are grateful for the support to make it possible for us to win back our democracy.</p>

    <p>But may I ask for one more favor?</p>


We will only win if people like you recruit others to join our experiment. Can you create your own personal pledge page on <a href="https://my.mayday.us/dashboard/new_from_pledge/{{user_url_nonce}}">MAYDAY.US</a> and recruit five friends to make a pledge?

    <p>This is just the beginning. But if we can succeed as we have so far, then by 2016, we will have taken the first critical step to getting our democracy back.</p>

    <p>This email serves as your receipt for your pledge of: {total}</p>

    <p>Thank you again,</p>

    <p>
