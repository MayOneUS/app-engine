With a little luck, the Harvard law professor&rsquo;s idea could help save the republic.</p></blockquote>

And he thinks that only a &ldquo;moonshot&rdquo; campaign &mdash; an ambitious, collective, national effort &ldquo;unlike anything they&rsquo;ve seen before&rdquo; &mdash; can &ldquo;crack this cynicism&rdquo; and usher in a more democratic system.</p></blockquote>

Proponents of serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political spending.</p><p>If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that&rsquo;s by design. Cynicism and defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig believes, that the only way to &ldquo;crack this cynicism&rdquo; is with an idea so exceedingly ambitious&mdash;a &ldquo;moonshoot,&rdquo; he calls it&mdash;that people might be roused to get behind it.</p><p>&ldquo;We must show Americans something unlike anything they&rsquo;ve seen before,&rdquo; Lessig <a style="color: #0c97d2;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/">writes</a>.</p></blockquote>
