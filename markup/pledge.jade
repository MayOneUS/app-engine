            p.
              If we don't meet our target, you don't pay. That way, you know
              that you will only pledge if there's enough money collected to
              make a difference. We'll charge your card now, but if we fail to
              meet our $5M goal by July 4th, your pledge will be refunded, and
              we go back to the drawing board.

            p.
              Some supporters prefer to donate regardless of whether we
              meet our goal or not. If you choose that option above, we'll do
              our best to make your donation count no matter what happens.
