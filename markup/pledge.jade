              h2 We are running an all or nothing campaign.
              p.
                If we don't meet our target, you don't pay. That way, you know
                that you will only pledge if there's enough money collected to
                make a difference. We'll charge your card now, but if we fail to
                meet our $5M goal by July 4th, your pledge will be refunded, and
                we go back to the drawing board.

              p.
                Some supporters prefer to donate regardless of whether we
                meet our goal or not. If you choose that option below, we'll do
                our best to make your donation count no matter what happens.
